# Assembly-Instructions
The executable instructions or simply instructions tell the processor what to do. Each instruction consists of an operation code (opcode). Each executable instruction generates one machine language instruction. The assembler directives or pseudo-ops tell the assembler about the various aspects of the assembly process.
